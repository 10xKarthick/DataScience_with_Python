# What is Data science

As the world entered the era of big data, the need for data also grew. Products like Hadoop and other frameworks solved this issue. The focus shifted to processing of the data.

> Data science is the future of Artificial Intelligence.

## The need for Data Science

Traditionally the data was structured and small in data, which could be analysed by using simple BI tools.

Today, the data is mostly unstructured or semi-structured.

This data is generated from different sources like financial logs, text files, multimedia forms, sensors, and instruments.

> Simple BI tools are not capable of processing this huge volume and variety of data.

This is why we need more complex and advanced analytical tools and algorithms for processing, analyzing and drawing meaningful insights out of it.

This is not the only reason why Data Science has become so popular. Letâ€™s dig deeper and see how Data Science is being used in various domains.

* With a customer's past browsing history, purchase history, age and income, you can train models with this vast amount and variety of data,to more effictively and recomment the product to customers with more precision.

* Self driving cars collect live data from sensors, including radars, camers and lasers to create a map of its surrounfs, Based on this data, it takes decisions like when to speed up, when to slow down, when to change lanes - making use of advanced machine learning algorithms.

* Data from ships, aircrafts, radars, satellites can be collected and analysed to build models to not only forecast the weather but also in predicting the occurrence of any natural disasters.

Below are some of the domains where Data Science is used.

## Data Science

Data Science is a blend of various tools, algorithms, and machine learning principles with the goal to discover hidden patterns from the raw data.

### Data Analyst vs Data Scientist

<div style="text-align:center; background: white;"><img src="https://www.edureka.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Data-Analyst-vs-Data-Science-1-422x300.png" /></div>

From the above image, a Data Analyst usually explains what is going on by processing history of data.

Data Scientist, on the other hand, not only does the exploratory analysis to discover insights from it, but also various advanced machine learning algorithms to identify the occurrence of a particular event in the future.

A Data Scientist will look at the data from many angles, sometimes angles not known earlier.

So, Data Science is primarily used to make decisions and predictions making use of predictive causal analytics, prescriptive analytics (predictive plus decision science) and machine learning.

* **Predictive casual analytics:** Let's say you are a bank, giving loans to customers, but you're also concerned about the on time payment of EMIs. You can build a model based on the past payments and predict if the future payments will be on time or not.

* **Prescriptive analytics:** This can be explained as a intelligent model capable of taking its own decisions and ability to modify it with dynamic parameters. Self driving cars are best examples of this model.

* **Machine learning for making predictions:** If you want to build a model to predict the future trend, then machine learning is the best one. For example, a fraud detection model can be trained using a historical record of fraudulent purchases.

* **Machine learning for pattern discovery:** If you don't have a pattern to make predicitions, then you need to find out the hidden patterns within the dataset to make meaningful predictions. This is unsupervised learning as you don't have any predefined data. The most common algorithm used for pattern discover is clustering. For example, a telephone company can use clustering technique to find tower locations to ensure optimum signal strength.
